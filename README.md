# hello-world
this is my first repository with Github
-----------
Now, I decide to reuse this repository to record my ideas about Machine Learning, Data Mining, and all other data technologies.
The following folders are:
ML: machine learn, including sub-folders like datapre, nn, ga, optimisation
Chem: related with cheminformatics

and other new folders will be built in the future
